Step 1: Clone this repository
Step 2: Install the emscripten compiler. emscripten will take the place of gcc.
Step 3: Compile main.c using this command:
    emcc main.c -s USE_SDL=2 -O3 -s WASM=1 -o main.js

Notes:
- USE_SDL=2 allows us to make use of the C SDL library, which can interact with a canvas directly.
- -O3 is maximum optimisation. Drop it if you want faster compile times.
- To the best of my knowledge, WASM=1 is now redundant, with WASM being the default over asm.js for a while now. But I am not yet confident enough to omit this.
- main.js will be an emscripten js wrapper around the wasm.

Step 4: Launch a webserver. The browser will not directly load wasm if it is not being served.
The easiest is python. For 3.8, simply type this into the terminal:
    python -m http.server 8080
For earlier versions of Python (including typical 2.7 system python), there is a similar command.
Step 5: Open home.html in the browser by navigating to the serving IP and port.
